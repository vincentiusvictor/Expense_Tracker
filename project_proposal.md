### Team Project - Vincent and Wilson

# Main idea: Expense Tracker
Topics: 
* Finance
* Budgeting
* Analytics

Minimum Product Specifications: 
* Record expenses between any period of time
* Track recurring payments (e.g. subscriptions)
* Data storage
* Analytics of the inputted data

Additional Specifications:
* Spending management and control
* Simple User Interface


# Learning Goals
Shared learning goals: 
* Working concurrently with multiple members (collaboration)
* Supporting each other's flaws
* Combining ideas and codes

Individual learning goals: 
* Fluency in python coding
* Advanced problem solving skills
* Resilliance after mistakes


# Implementation plans
Possible Libraries and Frameworks:
* Sqlite3 library (for databases)
* Tkinter library (for gui)
* Matplotllib (for graphs)

Rough plan of the project:
* Spending tracker for the foundation
* Data analytics with the raw data
* Generating graph


# Project Schedule
Weeks Number
1. Create spending database
2. Building base spending tracker
3. Building base spending tracker
4. Create analytics features
5. Create analytuics features
6. GUI
7. GUI
8. Finalize/polish


# Collaboration Plan
We delegate different functions and aspects of the application separately, using separate python files.
All these files will be compiled on Github where we can reconcile our workings and put together the entire product.
We produce features using the Agile method, as our product requires multiple tiers of feature sets.
As a result at the end of every 1-2 weeks all members will work together and pair program the product.


# Risk
* Writers block / stuck with progress
* Inability to intergrate all the different features into one piece (e.g. tracker and analytics)
* Time constraints for some aspects of the tracker
